# ethnicity_read_codes

For my PhD project I'm using primary care data from the [Optimum Patient Care Research Database](https://opcrd.co.uk). In order to derive a variable for patient ethnicity, I wanted a comprehensive Read code list meeting the following criteria:  
1. Includes both version 2 and version 3 Read codes. 
2. Includes both the 2001 and 2011 censuses. 
3. Is mapped to validated ethnicity categories.  

There are several great Read code resources (e.g. OpenSafely), but I couldn't find any that satisfy these three criteria.
